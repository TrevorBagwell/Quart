This is the folder space that deals with all mathematical handlings of string based expressions.

This is an interpreter and will basically make it super easy for those who don't know how to code in C++ to make math things in C++ without the difficulty of handling it in C++

Structures will be:
> expression: An expression holder that allows you to analyze expressions to mathematical formats. Basically allows for inline interpretation when need be.
> expression_handler: Allows one to handle a generic expression
