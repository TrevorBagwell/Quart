Tapes:
> Tapes are any index referenced collection of the same type where the information is stored contigously. 
> Elements of a tape always have the same type, ensuring certain mathematical limitations and enabling significant reduction of complexity of mathematical operations.
> Tapes contain an accesser for each of their elements and can tell their size.


> Tapes have 4 ways of obtaining data:
>> Direct Instantiation: Taking in a collection of already existing prvalues and creating a collection that can hold them directly
>> Copying a Tape: The tape memory can be called by copying the data of the tape and then cloning each elements data in the existing tapes location
>> Cloning a Tape: Cloning a tape copies the reference to the space and the size. A clone of a tape accesses the tape's space directly and 

>> The ability to identify whether something is a clone is quite important.
>> Thats why if we need to rehandle the
