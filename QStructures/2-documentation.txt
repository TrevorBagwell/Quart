Tape:
> A tape is a generic model for an augmented simple array. It's namesake is a turing tape, an infinite array of bits. However, we can only model tapes, so we have to do finite sized tapes.

> Functions:

>> Constructor
>>> Takes in a number (preset to 0 if no number is provided) that allocates an array of the size of the given number, or in the instance of it being 0, sets it to null.

>> Destructor
>>> Deletes the array

>> Index operator
>>> Takes in an index (don't know what to define it as yet) and returns the itemat the given location

>> Equality operator between 2 tapes of the same type
>>> Clones the data from the second tape to the first tape
